# Cyber-threats and Vulnerability Information Database (CyVID)
CyVID can be used to extract, refine, merge, classify and utilize vulnerability information from two major vulnerability databases, NIST's NVD and MITRE's CVE.
We have used CyVID to:
* Combine datasets from both NVD and CVE into a more descriptive vulnerability information system, 
* Identify vulnerabilities within a target network, and 
* Classify vulnerabilities based on vulnerability types, severity, products, and nodes. 

### CyVID Architecture:

### Target Network

### Results
We evaluate the proposed framework on a target network and discuss the derived results.
